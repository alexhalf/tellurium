Tellurium is a JavaScript Testing Framework using testing patterns like Mock, Stub, and Spy.

Features:

* Support asynchronous specifications by default
* Support syncronous specifications via .sync()
* Support Scripted test by default
* Support guided tests via .guided()
* ... (yes there is more but why dont you give it a try?)

This framework tries to go as close as possible with EcmaScript behaviour. so if you used anothers language
testing frameworks you may find that some of your tools are not here but trust me its better this way.

Does it work?
Yes Tellurium is tested with Tellurium

Is is used for other projects?
Yes it is but not many yet. but it really works, if not pls send me an issue or a msg.

Ok how can I use it?

var someObj = {
  good : true;
};

Tellurium.suite('my first test')({
  this.specify('someObj must be good')({
    this.assert(someObj.good).toBe(true);
  });
});

Tellurium.run();
